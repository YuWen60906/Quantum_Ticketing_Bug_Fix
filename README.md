# Maximum Accountability Ticketing ("Que")  by Quantum Strategies.
‚ùó **REMEMBER:** Minimum Viable Product (V1 baseline working version without any frills) is set for **April 6th, 2022.** ‚ùó
####

## Branching convention:
feat/staging/{issue#}-{feature-name}
Example: Issue #163, status sort, would be feat/staging/163-status-sort

When you are working on a task, always make sure you:
1) Create an issue (if it isn't already created) for the task you are working on.
2) Assign yourself to the issue. Doing this makes sure someone else does not not accidentally work on the same issue, or - if they want to jump in and help you - they know it's currently being worked on and can communicate with you.

Also, be sure to create a branch with the issue # included in the name, since it is guaranteed the branch will be available, and all issue #'s are unique. An example of this can be seen above.

**Easy Way to Do This:** A good way to do this is on the page of the actual issue. There is an option on the right-side navigation bar under 'Development' -> 'Create a Branch'. If you click on create a branch, it creates a branch from the issue, allowing anyone to be able to understand exactly which issue correlates to which branch. **Be sure to click on "Change branch source" and set it as "staging".**
